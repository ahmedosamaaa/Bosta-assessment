👉 **RTL Support**: Ensures a seamless experience for Right-to-Left languages
like Arabic, with proper alignment and date formatting.


👉 **Dark Mode Support**: Adds a user-friendly dark mode for comfortable viewing in low-light environments, with smooth transitions between light and dark themes.

👉 **Customizable Theme**: Provides the flexibility to adjust colors and themes,
allowing it to match the parent application's branding.

👉 **Modern Styling with TailwindCSS**: Utilizes TailwindCSS for a responsive
and visually appealing design, ensuring compatibility with different screen
sizes.

👉 **Date-Based Grouping**: Organizes shipment events under visually distinct
headers based on their dates for better readability and navigation.

👉 **Dynamic Event Visibility**: Automatically hides additional events
(beyond 5) under a group and includes a stylish "Show More" button for users to
reveal them.

👉 **Timeline Visualization**: Each shipment event appears on a clean,
structured timeline, making it easier to follow the shipment's progress.

👉 **Light and Minimal Aesthetic**: Keeps the interface clean and
distraction-free with minimalistic styling.
